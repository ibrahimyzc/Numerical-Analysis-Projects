# Numerical Analysis Projects

This repository contains a collection of numerical analysis projects completed during my PhD at the University of Pittsburgh. These projects cover various numerical methods and include implementations using MATLAB and FreeFEM++. Each folder contains a specific project along with its respective code, documentation, and results.

## Project Descriptions

### 1. Domain Decomposition for Mixed Finite Elements
This project explores overlapping and non-overlapping domain decomposition algorithms for solving elliptic problems using mixed finite element methods (MFE). We implemented both Schwarz and Shur-complement methods using FreeFEM++.

### 2. Finite Difference Methods
This project focuses on solving boundary value problems using different finite difference methods, including the shooting method, symmetric finite difference, and upwind finite difference methods.

### 3. Finite Element Methods for Elliptic PDEs
Here, we use finite element methods to solve elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) on structured grids. The code is implemented using MATLAB, with a focus on error analysis and convergence properties.

### 4. Mixed Finite Element Methods for Coupled Flow and Transport
This project solves coupled flow and transport problems using mixed finite element methods (MFE) in FreeFEM++. It includes Darcy flow computation and contaminant transport simulations.

### 5. Mixed Finite Element Methods for Flow
This project involves solving flow equations using mixed finite element methods. The focus is on solving flow problems such as Darcyâ€™s Law using RT0 elements in FreeFEM++.
